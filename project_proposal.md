## App Description
This app allows users to have a platform that records their daily activities, to-dos, and any other random thoughts, providing a personal database for keeping track of past memories and incoming tasks. The app enforces the rule of minimalism and provides some supplementary tools such as selfie analysis for users to customize their way of recording. 

## Minimal Goals

* Contains a list of templates or theme settings that users can choose for their notes.
* Have an easily accessible memo feature.
* Make daily to-do lists.
* Convert notes to image and share to other applications.

## Stretch Goals
* Since this app is highly extensible, and we have the following features to add to the app.

* Users can add voice memos to the notes and potentially we can add the feature of voice to text.
* Create a nice-looking logo.
