## Project Team 26
   * Hongyang Lin
   * Youhan Dou
   * Siyao Li
 
## Original Goals
* Able to change the template for different notes and theme settings for the app.
* Separate the tabs for memos. to-dos, and diaries.
* Toggle to view different dates or months of the notes.
 
 
## Project Progress and Reflection
### Main Menu
* Implemented edge swipe gesture that allows user to switch between todo-list and notes by swiping from the left or right edges.
* Added top panel with two buttons that navigates to calendar and setting.
* Resolved the problem of the bottom right floating menu showing up all the time.
* Implemented a new approach of dragging up animation to avoid minor visual issues.
 
### Todo List
* Replaced the swiftui original list with a custom list.
* The custom list brings more flexibility, such as modifying the delete button, removing the separation line, changing the background color, avoiding empty paddings.
 
### Calendar
* Designed a calendar to navigate to filtered notes by date.
* Implemented the functionality of bolding the dates that have stored notes, which is more convenient for users to find the note they need to check.
 
### Setting
* Designed a setting view at the main menu with the option to change the theme color of the app.
* Refactored our app to be color consistent and balanced.
 
### Visual
* Added more transitions and animations between view changes
